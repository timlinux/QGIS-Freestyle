# QGIS-Freestyle
QGIS Open Day Freestyle Sessions

**August 27 2021 QGIS Freestyle Session:** Please see issue [#1](https://github.com/timlinux/QGIS-Freestyle/issues/1)

# How to participate

Participating is easy and we invite EVERYONE to play along!

Look in the session list above and follow the link to the session issue.

Each session will have an associated dataset which is going to differ for each session and will be things like a randomly generated DEM, sample data, an extract from OSM etc. We will decide before each session what data we will provide.

The DEM will be shared on GitHub. Download the provided dataset.

You can follow along by downloading the DEM. What follows will be a freestyle session where we take the dataset and see how interesting a map or other product we can make with it using only the data, datasets derived from it, or new data captured locally during the session. You can follow along trying to replicate what we do or use your imagination to make your own fantasy map / project. You can create any new derived, generated, or hand created data to augment the initial data we have provided. You may **not** use any existing dataset or pre-prepared data during the session other than the data we provide.

You can use anything that QGIS support e.g. workflows in PostGIS, GRASS, SAGA, using plugins, etc. Whatever you like!

When you have produced your masterpiece, create a new comment on the issue for this session and drop an image (Hi-Res would be nice) of your work and optionally the QGIS project and all related resources if you want others to be able to reproduce it. You can make your image via report / layout / simple screengrab etc. in QGIS.

The best entry will become the proud owner of a QGIS Mug!  We will contact you if you have won via a comment on this ticket and you can then email us privately to provide your postage details for us to send the mug to you.
